# DAOToken
[see the generated documentation](../../generated_docs/controller/DAOToken.md)

The *DAOToken* is an *ERC20* compatible token that can be used to assign value and reward the DAO's members for their contributions.
Each *DAOToken* is controlled by the DAO it belongs to via the controller.

The *DAOToken* can be **minted** or **burned** by the DAO and also be **destroyed** in the event of an upgrade to a better token or in other circumstances.
